I took some courses on the [Udemy Platform](https://www.udemy.com/) and I'm following the indicates of Corey Schafer on his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epDKamC-V-8). 

The aim of this course was to learn how to create interfaces in Python using the `Tkinter` Python library.

Useful . It's part of the Standard libraries of Python.

Some remarkable pictures obtained in the learning process:
